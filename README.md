</p>


## Features
- Classic snake mechanics: eat food to grow longer
- Arrow keys for movement (Up/Down/Left/Right)
- Score tracking system
- Game over when hitting walls or yourself
- Simple, clean UI with color-coded elements

## Requirements
- **Python 3.11** (required for precompiled wheel compatibility)
- Pygame (`pygame==2.6.1`)

## Installation & Setup
### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv snake_venv
```

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell):
.\snake_venv\Scripts\activate.ps1

```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install --user "C:\Users\redacted\Desktop\sqwn\pygame-2.6.1-cp311-win_amd64.whl"
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: The wheel file requires Python 3.11. If you're using a different version, [download the correct wheel](https://www.pygame.org/download.html) or install from source.

## Running the Game
```bash
python snake.py
```

### Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↑   | Move Up |
| ↓   | Move Down |
| ←   | Move Left |
| →   | Move Right |

## Technical Details
- Built using **Pygame 2.11** for cross-platform compatibility
- Uses a simple grid-based movement system
- Score increases by 10 points per food item eaten
- Game ends when snake collides with wall or itself

**Note**: This implementation requires the precompiled wheel file (`pygame-2.6.1-cp311-win_amd64.whl`) due to Windows-specific build requirements. Do not attempt to compile from source on Python 3.12+ as it will fail.
